## Why?

The main aim of this Framework is to make it as easy as possible for developing an Angular 2 app whilst having the latest technologies/crucial technologies required.

## TypeScript

TypeScript starts from the same syntax and semantics that millions of JavaScript developers know today. Use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript code from JavaScript.

TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs on any browser, in Node.js, or in any JavaScript engine that supports ECMAScript 3 (or newer).

TypeScript offers support for the latest and evolving JavaScript features, including those from ECMAScript 2015 and future proposals, like async functions and decorators, to help build robust components.

These features are available at development time for high-confidence app development, but are compiled into simple JavaScript that targets ECMAScript 3 (or newer) environments.

## REST API

You can find your Model's and Controller's inside the ```api/``` folder.

Once you have a controller created e.g ```api/controllers/ExampleController```, you can use it as a REST API endpoint:

```
POST /example/create?name=Michael   C
GET  /example/read                  R
POST /example/update/1              U
POST /example/delete?id=1           D
```

## ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

Bookshelf aims to provide a simple library for common tasks when querying databases in JavaScript, and forming relations between these objects, taking a lot of ideas from the the Data Mapper Pattern.

With a concise, literate codebase, Bookshelf is simple to read, understand, and extend. It doesn't force you to use any specific validation scheme, provides flexible and efficient relation/nested-relation loading, and first class transaction support.

It's a lean Object Relational Mapper, allowing you to drop down to the raw knex interface whenever you need a custom query that doesn't quite fit with the stock conventions.

## Socket.io Ready

[COMING SOON]

## Angular2

Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.

You can find your Angular codebase inside the ```app/``` folder.

## SASS

Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

Sass boasts more features and abilities than any other CSS extension language out there. The Sass Core Team has worked endlessly to not only keep up, but stay ahead.

### Susy

In a world of agile development and super-tablet-multi-magic-laptop-phones, the best layouts can’t be contained in a single framework or technique. CSS Libraries are a bloated mess of opinions about how to do your job. Why let the table-saw tell you where to put the kitchen?

Your markup, your design, your opinions | our math.

## Bundle for production with Rollup

Rollup is a next-generation JavaScript module bundler. Author your app or library using ES2015 modules, then efficiently bundle them up into a single file for use in browsers and Node.js – even if you use advanced features like bindings and cycles.
